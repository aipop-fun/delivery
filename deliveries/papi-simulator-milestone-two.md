* **DOT Payment Address:** [13eJfzT8u1qKYkFDW6o7Ta19eGi9X8Y74cWLDComEVxbKGMa](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13eJfzT8u1qKYkFDW6o7Ta19eGi9X8Y74cWLDComEVxbKGMa)
**Context**

This milestone focuses on expanding the Polkadot API Playground with advanced component development capabilities, transaction building tools, and a comprehensive export system. The deliverables enable developers to not only experiment with Polkadot APIs but also create, customize, and export production-ready React components for use in their own projects. This milestone significantly enhances the value proposition by transforming the playground from a learning tool into a complete development environment for Polkadot ecosystem applications.

## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Component System Architecture
The component system is built on a modular architecture that supports:
- **Template Engine**: Dynamic component generation with customizable properties
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types for each parachain
- **Dependency Management**: Intelligent bundling that includes only necessary dependencies
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning for exported components with upgrade paths

### Export System Features
- **Multi-format Support**: ESM, CommonJS, and UMD builds
- **Framework Optimization**: Tailored exports for different React frameworks
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic detection and inclusion of required packages
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generated component documentation and usage examples

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for templates and advanced features
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching of chain descriptors and component builds
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking and dead code elimination for exports
